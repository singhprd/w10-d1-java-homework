Homework 1

Give me my change!

Refactor your CashRegister.java program so that it can print out the coins that make up a person's change.

Rename method giveChange() to calculateChange()

Add a new method giveChange() which calls calculateChange() method and stores the result in a double variable then determines how many of each coin to return and prints the results in the console.

HINT: Review syntax for if then else statements: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html


Example output:
Cash to be given: £4.89
£1 coins : 4
50p coins: 1
20p coins: 1
10p coins: 1
5p coins: 1
2p coins: 2
